title: Week 8

This week things became complicated because the FINs project is a 3 year proposal that includes a lot of components such as enthograpghic data, the actual application, data modeling, nutritional information, community ties, etc. However, being apart of the technical team of the project, I am doing the HCI work, but we did not pay attention to the many aspects we would need to begin this proposal. So, we needed to scope the project beefore going further ahead with the narratives. Other things we needed to consider were how to present nutrtional information in an easier way for consumers to compare it to other items, how can we include theories such as information foraging or Maslow's hierarchy to understand how people shop for groceries, and do we need an actual visual narrative to present food information or does the current models suffice as long as we change the order of items on the page. So, this week I need to take a step back and reevaluate how we want want to actually begin this grant.
