This week we wanted to build some prototype webpages to present different types of narratives, so I used Figma in attempt to create these narratives. However, I ran into the problem that Figma does not give a scrolling option for desktop, so instead I decided to just draw out the narratives on my Ipad. I also went back through papers examining what type of surveys and lab-study we would like to run when we are ready to experiment this. I also already had my IRB certification done at my past intitution, but I still was requrired to do an extra module since I go to Notre Dame. So, I got that done since we were getting to an experiment talk.
