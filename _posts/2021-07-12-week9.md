While I needed to re-evaluate how to start this grant and decide a direction we want to begin in, I was also responsible for the individual food item mapping to help the team who will begin the data modeling. In order to do this, I had to take the 25 most common foods that people buy, and locate their long food code description and their food code in FNDDS and Standard Reference databases provided by USDA. After I did an initial mapping, I had to do it again because there were some errors in my mapping after the nutritional team checked my work.
